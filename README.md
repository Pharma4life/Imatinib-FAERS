# Imatinib-FAERS

This is part of my code for my Master Thesis titled ”Acute kidney injury associated with the use of Imatinib. An analysis of the reports registered in FAERS.”

The code is written in python and it includes the extraction and manipulation of data. The main function creates and excel file and it exports it as ”data.xlsx”.
